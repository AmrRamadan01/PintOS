>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

! In a call to timer_sleep(ticks), the current thread is put to sleep for a specified number of ticks. The function does this by performing the following steps:

1. Calculates the wake-up time for the current thread by adding the current number of ticks to the number of ticks passed as an argument. It then stores this wake-up time in the waketick field of the current thread.
2. Inserts the current thread into the sleep_list in order of wake-up time using the list_insert_ordered function.
3. Blocks the current thread using the thread_block function, which means that it will not be scheduled to run until it is unblocked by another thread.

In a call to timer_interrupt, the timer interrupt handler is executed.
This function is called periodically by the timer interrupt, which is generated by the hardware timer in the system. The function performs the following steps:

1. Increments the global ticks variable.
2. Calls the thread_tick function, which updates the current thread's statistics and performs any necessary thread scheduling.
3. Checks if the sleep_list is empty. If it is empty, the function simply returns.
4. else, the function gets a pointer to the first thread and Checks if the wake-up time of the first thread in the list is greater than the current number of ticks. If it is, the function breaks out of the loop and returns.
5. If the wake-up time of the first thread in the list is less than or equal to the current number of ticks, the function removes the first thread from the sleep_list using the list_remove function.
6. Unblocks the thread using the thread_unblock function, which means that it will be added to the ready queue and will be scheduled to run again by the thread scheduler.

			 PRIORITY SCHEDULING
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid

			  ADVANCED SCHEDULER
			  ==================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Suppose threads A, B, and C have nice values 0, 1, and 2.  Each
>> has a recent_cpu value of 0.  Fill in the table below showing the
>> scheduling decision and the priority and recent_cpu values for each
>> thread after each given number of timer ticks:

timer  recent_cpu    priority   thread
ticks   A   B   C   A   B   C   to run
-----  --  --  --  --  --  --   ------

>> C3: Did any ambiguities in the scheduler specification make values
>> in the table uncertain?  If so, what rule did you use to resolve
>> them?  Does this match the behavior of your scheduler?

>> C4: How is the way you divided the cost of scheduling between code
>> inside and outside interrupt context likely to affect performance?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> time to work on this part of the project, how might you choose to
>> refine or improve your design?

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future semesters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the semester.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future semesters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future semesters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
